    title: "Rising Sea Levels",
    text: "The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. As the ocean warms, its volume increases since water expands as it gets warmer. Melting ice sheets also cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal and island communities. The major physical impacts of a rise in sea level include erosion of beaches, inundation of deltas as well as flooding and loss of many marshes and wetlands. Increased salinity will likely become a problem in coastal aquifers and estuarine systems as a result of saltwater intrusion. Damage to and loss of coastal areas would jeopardize the economic and ecological amenities provided by coastal wetlands and marshes, including flood control, critical ecological habitat, and water purification.",

    text: "The world’s richest people emit huge and unsustainable amounts of carbon and, unlike ordinary people, 50% to 70% of their emissions result from their investments. 125 of the world’s richest billionaires show that on average they emit 3 million tonnes a year, more than a million times the average for someone in the bottom 90% of humanity. Billionaires hold extensive stakes in many of the world’s largest and most powerful corporations, which gives them the power to influence the way these companies act. The role of the super-rich in super-charging climate change is rarely discussed. These billionaire investors at the top of the corporate pyramid have huge responsibility for driving climate breakdown.",
