    title: "Thawing Permafrost",
    text: "As Earth’s climate warms, the permafrost thaws. The ice inside the permafrost melts, leaving behind water and soil. Thawing permafrost can have dramatic impacts on our planet. It can destroy houses, roads and other infrastructure. When permafrost is frozen, plant material in the soil—called organic carbon—can’t decompose. As permafrost thaws, microbes begin decomposing this material. This process releases greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. When permafrost thaws, so do ancient bacteria and viruses in the ice and soil. These newly-unfrozen microbes could make humans and animals very sick.",

      "As Earth’s climate warms, the permafrost thaws. That means the ice inside the permafrost melts, leaving behind water and soil. Thawing permafrost can have dramatic impacts on our planet and the things living on it. Many northern villages are built on permafrost. When permafrost is frozen, it’s harder than concrete. However, thawing permafrost can destroy houses, roads and other infrastructure. When permafrost is frozen, plant material in the soil—called organic carbon—can’t decompose, or rot away. As permafrost thaws, microbes begin decomposing this material. This process releases greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere. When permafrost thaws, so do ancient bacteria and viruses in the ice and soil. These newly-unfrozen microbes could make humans and animals very sick. Scientists have discovered microbes more than 400,000 years old in thawed permafrost.\n\nAs those gasses escape into the atmosphere, they further warm the climate, creating a feedback loop: Warmer temperatures thaw more soil, releasing more organic material for microbes to feast on and produce more greenhouse gasses. Permafrost is estimated to hold twice as much carbon as the atmosphere today.",

    text: "Destructive storms have become more intense and more frequent in many regions. As temperatures rise, more moisture evaporates, which exacerbates extreme rainfall and flooding, causing more destructive storms. The frequency and extent of tropical storms is also affected by the warming ocean. Cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons feed on warm waters at the ocean surface. Such storms often destroy homes and communities, causing deaths and huge economic losses.",

The frequency and extent of tropical storms is also affected by the warming ocean. Cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons feed on warm waters at the ocean surface. Such storms often destroy homes and communities, causing deaths and huge economic losses.\n\nWith increasing global surface temperatures the possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur. As more water vapor is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes fuel for more powerful storms to develop. More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in tropical storms. Rising sea levels expose higher locations not usually subjected to the power of the sea and to the erosive forces of waves and currents.So it’s reasonable to assume that as humans continue to release planet-warming greenhouse gasses, the likelihood of tropical cyclone activity increases.",

As the ocean warms, its volume increases since water expands as it gets warmer. Melting ice sheets also cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal and island communities.

As the ocean warms, its volume increases since water expands as it gets warmer. Melting ice sheets also cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal and island communities. The major physical impacts of a rise in sea level include erosion of beaches, inundation of deltas as well as flooding and loss of many marshes and wetlands. Damage to and loss of coastal areas would jeopardize the economic and ecological amenities provided by coastal wetlands and marshes, including flood control, critical ecological habitat, and water purification.\n\nThe warming of the ocean causes a number of alarming problems. It provides more energy to tropical cyclones, which are getting stronger and intensifying faster. As more water evaporates from warmer oceans, the rate of global rainfall increases. This adds to heavy rainfall events that can cause flooding rather than alleviating droughts. Warming also tends to diminish the oceans’ ability to act as a sink for carbon dioxide. Ocean warming also has a detrimental effect on marine biology, causing calamities such as coral bleaching.",
