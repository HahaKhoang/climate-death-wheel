      Human-induced warming has already reached about 1°C above pre-industrial
      levels at the time of writing of this Special Report. By the decade
      2006–2015, human activity had warmed the world by 0.87°C (±0.12°C)
      compared to pre-industrial times (1850–1900). If the current warming rate
      continues, the world would reach human-induced global warming of 1.5°C
      around 2040.
