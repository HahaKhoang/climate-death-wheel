Climate Death Wheel is an interactive web based project inspired by a climate strike sign I made for the Fridays for Future school strikes.

It is undeniable that humans have had a significant impact on the climate. The visitor is encouraged to spin the wheel, and add the result of their death to the interactive map at the bottom of the page.

- This project was built with Vite, Typescript, and Sass
- React Leaflet was used to allow users to add their location and cause of death to the interactive map
- Uses Firebase as a backend to send and retrieve data about visitor's locations and deaths
