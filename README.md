Climate Death Wheel is an interactive web based project inspired by a climate strike sign I made for the Fridays for Future school strikes.

It is undeniable that humans have had a significant impact on the climate. The visitor is encouraged to spin the wheel, and add the result of their death to the interactive map at the bottom of the page.

PLEASE NOTE: The location field in the form is no longer working because I no longer have access to the free trial for Google's Places API.

- This project was built with React and Sass
- React Leaflet was used to allow users to add their location and cause of death to the interactive map
- Used Firebase as a backend to send and retrieve data about visitor's locations and deaths
